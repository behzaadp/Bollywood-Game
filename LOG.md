My initial idea is to store an already made list with a bunch
of bollywood movie names and the user can play it in terminal.
-I am getting a random movie from list.

-changed the rules a bit for now(no vowels will be provided)
so that I can focus more on the overall game than just one aspect
-I think the providing vowels will be the easy mode when I make
GUI, and without vowels will be the normal mode
-Implementing single word movies would be easier imo
