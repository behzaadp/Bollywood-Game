This game is basically hangman but for bollywood movies.

RULES:
1) A random movie will be given to you, and you have to guess it
in 9 chances(the number of letters in the word BOLLYWOOD).
2) Vowels will be provided to you, so you have to guess the
consonants and the numbers(if any).
3) With each wrong guess, the number of chances will decrease by 1.
And the letters in the word BOLLYWOOD will be struck out one by one.
For example, if you guess 'R' and it is not present in the movie's
name then there will be a strikethrough, ~~B~~OLLYWOOD.
4) If you have a certain number of wrong guesses, and you guess
the same letter as the first non-stricken letter in 'BOLLYWOOD' and
it turns out to be wrong, you won't lose a chance.
For example, if you have 4 chances left, i.e. ~~BOLLY~~WOOD, and
if you guess 'W' and it turns out to be a wrong guess then you
won't lose a chance.
